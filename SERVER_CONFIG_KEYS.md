# Server Config Keys

This file tracks the known `config/UserGame.ini` override keys in this repo.
Values here are server-side overrides unless a note says the client also needs
the same value.

For the exhaustive generated index of every key present in Funcom's shipped
`DefaultGame.ini`, see `SERVER_CONFIG_KEY_INDEX.md`. That file lists 2,242 raw
key entries across 156 sections and marks each as known, inferred, UI/visual,
asset/reference, or unknown/investigate.

For binary-only research candidates, see `SERVER_BINARY_CONFIG_CANDIDATES.md`.
That file is generated from strings in `DuneSandboxServer-Linux-Shipping` after
excluding keys already present in `DefaultGame.ini`. Treat those entries as
leads, not confirmed config keys.

For runtime/database notes, see `SERVER_RUNTIME_SURFACES.md`. That file maps
high-value config sections to shipped DB tables/functions and records observed
live state from the local all-maps stack.

Evidence levels:

- Known: present in Funcom's shipped default/setup config or already validated in local use.
- Inferred: exposed by shipped server binaries or naming, but still needs live validation.
- Unknown / investigate: carried from shipped config or repo history, but exact gameplay effect needs testing.

## Current Overrides

| INI section | Key | Current value | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.PvpPveSettings]` | `m_bShouldForceEnablePvpOnAllPartitions` | `False` | Known | Global PvP override. `True` should force PvP on all partitions; `False` leaves normal partition/security-zone rules in control. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.PvpPveSettings]` | `+m_PvpEnabledPartitions` | commented examples `1`, `2` | Unknown / investigate | Per-partition PvP allow-list. Present as commented examples in the shipped setup config. Needs live validation before enabling. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.SecurityZonesSubsystem]` | `m_bAreSecurityZonesEnabled` | `True` | Known | Enables security zones. Turning this off should disable the server-side security-zone system. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.PingSystemSettings]` | `m_PingsPerPlayerLimit` | `10` | Inferred / validate | Private-server group QoL override. Shipped default is `5`; raises simultaneous ping capacity for exploration/coordination. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.PingSystemSettings]` | `m_PingMaximumDistance` | `5000.000000` | Inferred / validate | Private-server group QoL override. Shipped default is `2000`; extends ping placement/use distance. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.PingSystemSettings]` | `m_PingInWorldMarkerExpiryTime` | `15` | Inferred / validate | Private-server group QoL override. Shipped default is `5`; keeps in-world pings visible longer. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.PingSystemSettings]` | `m_PingMapMarkerExpiryTime` | `300` | Inferred / validate | Private-server group QoL override. Shipped default is `60`; keeps map pings visible longer. |
| `[/DeteriorationSystem.ItemDeteriorationConstants]` | `UpdateRateInSeconds` | `1.0` | Known | Item deterioration tick/update cadence in seconds. Lower values update more frequently; higher values update less frequently. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.SpiceHarvestingSystem]` | `m_PerMapSystemSettings` | Deep Desert small `60/60`, medium `24/24`, large `3/3`; Survival small `5/5` | Known / validate balance | Private-server spice caps. Large fields are raised from shipped `1/1` to `3/3`; medium fields are raised to `24/24` for a busier Deep Desert. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.ContractsSubsystem]` | `m_MaxGlobalContractsNumberPerServer` | `20` | Inferred / validate | Private-server activity override. Shipped default is `10`; keeps more global contracts available on low-pop worlds. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.SandStormConfig]` | `m_bCoriolisAutoSpawnEnabled` | `False` | Known | Controls automatic Coriolis storm spawning. Shipped setup default is `True`; this repo disables auto-spawn. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.PlayerOnlineStateSettings]` | `m_DefaultReconnectGracePeriodSeconds` | `0` | Known | Normal-map reconnect grace period before the server stops preserving an offline/disconnected session. Shipped default observed in build `1963158` is `300`. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.PlayerOnlineStateSettings]` | `m_OvermapReturnGracePeriodSeconds` | `0` | Known | Overmap return/reconnect grace period. Shipped default observed in build `1963158` is `90`. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.PlayerOnlineStateSettings]` | `m_InstancedMapReconnectGracePeriodSeconds` | `0` | Known | Instanced-map reconnect grace period. Shipped default observed in build `1963158` is `300`. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.BuildingSettings]` | `m_MaxLandclaimSegmentsPerMap` | `(((Name="HaggaBasin"), 6),((Name="Survival_1"), 6),((Name="DeepDesert"), 6),((Name="DeepDesert_1"), 6))` | Inferred / validate | Map-level landclaim segment/base-distribution candidate. Deep Desert entries are a lab candidate for landclaim-backed Base Reconstruction Tool placement; this is not the observed per-player 3 subfief/totem cap. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.BuildingSettings]` | `m_MaxNumLandclaimSegments` | `10` | Known | Maximum connected landclaim segments per base/landclaim. Shipped default is `6`. Funcom's setup comment says this must also be applied to each client. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.BuildingSettings]` | `m_LimitNumberOfBuildablesPerServer` | `7500` | Candidate / validate | Binary-only total buildable/building-piece cap candidate. Added to test raising the observed `5000` cap, but likely not sufficient for a per-base cap by itself. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.BuildingSettings]` | `m_LimitNumberOfBuildablesPerMap` | `(((Name="HaggaBasin"), 7500),((Name="Survival_1"), 7500))` | Candidate / validate | Binary-only per-map total buildable/building-piece cap candidate. Set alongside the per-server cap so either validation path can pass, but likely not sufficient for a per-base cap by itself. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.BuildingSettings]` | `m_BuildingBlueprintMaxExtensions` | `4` | Known | Maximum number of times a building blueprint / landclaim can be expanded. Shipped default is `4`. This is not the active base-count knob. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.BuildingSettings]` | `m_BaseBackupMaxExtensions` | `8` | Known | Maximum extension count used by base backup/reconstruction-related data. Shipped default is `8`. This is not the active base-count knob. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.BuildingSettings]` | `m_BaseBackupToolMapRestriction` | `((Name="HaggaBasin"), (Name="Survival_1"), (Name="DeepDesert"), (Name="DeepDesert_1"), (Name="Editor_Default"), (Name="IGW_Test_Small"))` | Inferred / validate | BRT map allow-list candidate. Shipped/default evidence excluded Deep Desert, matching the "base backup not allowed in this region" symptom better than the landclaim segment limit alone. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.BuildingSettings]` | `m_bBuildingRestrictionLimitsEnabled` | `True` | Known | Enables server-side building restriction limits. Funcom's setup comment says this must also be applied to each client. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.CharacterRecustomizerSubsystem]` | `m_CostAmount` | `0` | Known | Solaris cost for character recustomization. Shipped/default observed in build `1963158` is `5000`; this repo makes it free. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.DuneExchangeSettings]` | `SellOrderDailySolarisFee` | `0` | Known / validate balance | Private-server economy override. Shipped default is `20`; this repo keeps exchange listing friction removed. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.DuneExchangeSettings]` | `SellOrderPricePercentageFee` | `0.000000` | Known / validate balance | Private-server economy override. Shipped default is `2.000000`; this repo keeps exchange listing friction removed. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.GuildSettings]` | `m_MaxGuildsAllowed` | `999` | Inferred / validate | Private-server social override. Shipped default is `3`; removes the practical guild count cap for this community. |

## Building Knob Notes

- Target policy for this repo: 10 connected landclaim segments per base, plus investigation of map-level landclaim distribution.
- Segment cap: `m_MaxNumLandclaimSegments=10`.
- Map-level landclaim candidate: `m_MaxLandclaimSegmentsPerMap=...6...`.
- Total buildable/building-piece cap experiment: `m_LimitNumberOfBuildablesPerServer=7500` plus `m_LimitNumberOfBuildablesPerMap=...7500...`. Binary evidence is strong for the key names and `UBuildingSettings` ownership, but Funcom does not ship default values in `DefaultGame.ini`; live validation is required. Confidence is only low that these are the per-base `5000` piece cap, because live behavior allows multiple 5000-piece bases in one Hagga Basin map.
- Better per-base piece-cap lead: cooked data table `/Game/Dune/Systems/Building/Data/DT_BuildableStructureCategoryData`, row/category `BuildingPiece`, with fields including `m_BuildableStructureLimitsPerMap`, `m_BuildableStructureLimitsOnServer`, `m_MaximumNumberOfBuildables`, and `m_TargetNumberOfLandclaims`. The adjacent row payload contains a literal int32 `5000` inside the `BuildingPiece` row, before the `Production` row starts. Confidence is high that this asset contains the observed piece limit value; confidence is moderate that it is the per-base cap; confidence remains low on an INI override path because the asset is cooked/unversioned and no `.usmap` mappings were found. `scripts/patch-building-piece-limit-pak.py` can patch this value to `7500`; lab validation on `kspld0` proved the patched pak boots, but client placement beyond `5000` is still unproven.
- `m_BuildingBlueprintMaxExtensions` and `m_BaseBackupMaxExtensions` are extension/reconstruction limits, not the active base-count cap.
- The per-player 3 subfief/totem cap is not `m_MaxLandclaimSegmentsPerMap`. Binary evidence points to `SubfiefLimitBonus` / `SubfiefCount` as player attribute/UI state. This repo exposes `DUNE_SUBFIEF_LIMIT` as an experimental operator knob through `scripts/apply-subfief-limit-knob.sh`; the player-presence announcer also repairs joined/rejoined current pawn actors whose bonus is below the configured value.

## Other High-Value Shipped Sections

The exhaustive index has every key. These are the sections most likely to matter
for self-host tuning, based on shipped section/key names and defaults.

| INI section | Key(s) | Shipped value / summary | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[/Script/Engine.GameNetworkManager]` | movement/network timing keys | `ClientErrorUpdateRateLimit=0.35f`, `MaxMoveDeltaTime=0.25f`, movement discrepancy checks enabled | Inferred | Unreal network movement correction/throttling. Useful only if diagnosing movement/network desync; risky to tune blindly. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.MapFpsSettings]` | `+m_Maps` | 32 map FPS caps, commonly `20` for gameplay maps and `10` for hubs/overland | Inferred | Per-map dedicated server FPS cap. Candidate performance knob, but changing it changes CPU budget and simulation cadence. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.MapFeatures]` | `m_Maps` | Per-map feature flags: taxation, Deep Desert gameplay, shifting sands, social-only, story gameplay, instancing, outdoors, transfer flags | Inferred | Map capability matrix. High impact; do not override casually. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.PingSystemSettings]` | ping limits/ranges/expiry | limit `5`, max distance `2000`, world expiry `5`, map expiry `60` | Inferred | Player ping system limits and expiry timers. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.ShelterSettings]` | shelter traces/thresholds | trace length `10000`, building threshold `0.9`, placeable threshold `0.65` | Inferred | Shelter detection traces and thresholds. For base-only thirst reduction, prefer making bases count as sheltered instead of zeroing global dehydration. See `HYDRATION_WATER_KNOBS.md`. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.SpiceHarvestingSystem]` | spice field settings | per-map and default spice field active/primed counts | Inferred | Spice field spawning/activation system. Candidate economy/resource knob; needs live validation. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.HydrationSubsystem]` | hydration settings | `m_bHydrationEnabled=True`, hydration settings data asset; binary fields `m_DehydrationPerSecondBase`, `m_DehydrationRateScale`, `ShelteredProtectionThreshold` | Inferred | Player hydration/water behavior. `m_DehydrationPerSecondBase` and `m_DehydrationRateScale` are the global thirst-rate targets; `ShelteredProtectionThreshold` is the better candidate for no dehydration while in base. See `HYDRATION_WATER_KNOBS.md`. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.DewHarvestSettings]` | dew harvesting settings | dew harvesting keys | Inferred | Dew collection behavior. Exact safe knobs need targeted testing. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.CraftingSettings]` | crafting output multipliers | recipe multiplier lists and chance attributes | Inferred | Crafting output/economy tuning. Many values are data-table driven; validate before overriding. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.DuneVehicleSettings]` | vehicle settings | vehicle behavior and recovery-related keys | Inferred | Vehicle behavior, persistence, and recovery candidates. Needs focused testing. |
| `[/DeteriorationSystem.ItemDeteriorationConstants]` | `UpdateRateInSeconds` | `1.0` | Known | Deterioration rate/cadence. Shipped setup says `0=off`. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.SandwormSettings]` | sandworm settings | worm behavior tuning keys | Inferred | Sandworm behavior/threat tuning. High gameplay impact; validate carefully. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.SandStormConfig]` | storm settings | includes `m_bCoriolisAutoSpawnEnabled=True` in shipped setup/default | Known / inferred | Coriolis storm auto-spawn and related storm behavior. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.EncountersSubsystem]` | encounter settings | encounter subsystem keys | Inferred | World encounter spawning/selection. Needs targeted testing. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.ContractsSubsystem]` | contract settings | contract subsystem keys | Inferred | Contract generation/limits/rewards. Needs targeted testing. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.SecurityZonesSubsystem]` | security-zone settings | `m_bAreSecurityZonesEnabled=True` | Known | Security-zone system. Shipped setup says disabling allows PvP and ability use everywhere. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.InventorySystemSettings]` | inventory/economy settings | item stack/resource/vendor/mining settings | Inferred | Inventory/resource/economy behavior. Useful for admin tooling research, but unsafe to bulk-change. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.RespawnSettings]` | respawn maps/location limits | cross-map respawn enabled for Hagga Basin, Deep Desert disables checkpoint group, location group limits all `1` | Inferred | Respawn routing and allowed respawn location groups. High impact. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.CoriolisSubsystem]` | Coriolis cycle/wipe keys | cycle starts day `3` hour `5`, duration `7` days, restart on cycle end `True`, DB wipe `True` | Known / inferred | Deep Desert Coriolis cycle and wipe behavior. Very high impact; do not change without backup/testing. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.CoriolisSettings]` | `+m_IgnoredMarkersList` | many ignored marker types | Inferred | Marker categories ignored by Coriolis behavior/reset handling. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.PartySettings]` | `m_SocialRange` | `1000000.000000` | Inferred | Social/party interaction range. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.LootSettings]` | `GlobalLootRightsBehaviour` | `PerPlayerChestAndNpcDrop` | Known / inferred | Global loot-rights behavior. Strong candidate for loot policy tuning. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.GuildSettings]` | guild limits | creation cost `1000`, max guilds `3`, max members `32`, pending invites `10` | Inferred | Guild economy and capacity limits. Good self-host candidate after live validation. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.PlayerRequestSubsystem]` | request timeout/static data | notification timeout buffer `0.25` | Inferred | Player request UI/interaction behavior, such as duel/share request notifications. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.TravelDestinationSubsystem]` | travel destination asset | data asset reference | Asset/reference | Travel destination data source. Important for routing research, but not a simple scalar knob. |

## Runtime/Database Findings

These are not additional config keys; they are persistence surfaces found while
validating the shipped config.

| Area | DB evidence | Status | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spice fields | `spicefield_types`, `spicefield_server_availability`, `resourcefield_state`; functions such as `try_prime_spicefield`, `try_spawn_spicefield`, `update_global_spice_field_rules` | Known | Confirms `m_PerMapSystemSettings` caps are authoritative and live-observable. |
| Ordinary resource nodes | `actor_spawners`, `actor_spawner_actors`; runtime logs for `BP_AzuriteOre_*_Spawner`, `BP_ScrapMetal_*_Spawner`, and `BP_ImpureFuel_*_Spawner` | Inferred / investigate | Resource-node spawn chance keys are shipped, and binary strings prove `FResourceRespawnTimer`, but no safe respawn timer override is confirmed yet. See `RESOURCE_RESPAWN_KNOBS.md`. |
| Items/inventory | `items`, `inventories`, `actor_inventories`; functions such as `load_items`, `update_inventory`, `move_inventory_item`, `merge_inventory_items` | Known | Admin item grants should account for inventory ownership, free/mergeable slots, stack size, stats JSON, and quality. |
| Encounters | `encounters_static`; static encounter load/save functions only | Known / limited | Confirms static encounter persistence exists, but dynamic random encounter weights/caps are not in DB. |
| Buried treasure | No treasure tables/functions found; empty `DUNE-153318_nuke_persisted_buried_treasure.sql` migration | Inferred | Supports the current conclusion that buried treasure is runtime/asset driven in this build. |
| Patrol/crash sites | No patrol/crash-site tables/functions found | Inferred | Frequency/selection likely lives in level assets or runtime subsystem state, not Postgres. |
| Respawn | `player_respawn_locations`, `travel_return_info`, `player_travel_state` | Known | Provides the DB side for respawn/travel admin investigation. |
| Guilds | `guilds`, `guild_members`, `guild_invites` plus guild functions | Known | Config limits have matching persistence surfaces. |
| Vehicles | `vehicles`, `vehicle_modules`, `vehicle_module_inventories`, `backup_vehicles`, `recovered_vehicles` | Known / needs live examples | Schema is known, but this test farm has no vehicle rows yet. |
| Access codes | `player_access_codes` plus create/get/reset/delete functions | Known | Good candidate for admin-panel management through DB functions. |

## Binary-Only Keys Found So Far

These keys were found in the shipped server binary but not in the shipped
`DefaultGame.ini`. They can often still be valid Unreal config properties, but
they need live validation because Funcom did not ship default values for them.

| INI section | Key | Evidence | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.BuildingSettings]` | `m_MaxLandclaimSegmentsPerMap` | Binary contains `m_MaxLandclaimSegmentsPerMap` and `m_MaxLandclaimSegmentsPerMap_Key` near `UBuildingSettings` strings | Inferred / validate | Map-level landclaim candidate, not the per-player 3 subfief/totem cap. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.BuildingSettings]` | `m_LimitNumberOfBuildablesPerServer` | Binary contains `m_LimitNumberOfBuildablesPerServer`, `m_LimitNumberOfBuildablesPerMap`, and `m_MaximumNumberOfBuildables` near `UBuildingSettings` / buildable-structure-limit strings | Candidate / validate | Likely total buildable/building-piece cap. Added as an experimental override at `7500` to test raising the observed `5000` limit. Low confidence that this is the per-base cap by itself. |
| `[/Script/DuneSandbox.BuildingSettings]` | `m_LimitNumberOfBuildablesPerMap` | Binary contains `m_LimitNumberOfBuildablesPerMap` and `m_LimitNumberOfBuildablesPerMap_Key` near `UBuildingSettings` / buildable-structure-limit strings | Candidate / validate | Per-map companion to the total buildable cap candidate. Current override targets `HaggaBasin` and `Survival_1`. Low confidence that this is the per-base cap by itself. |
| Cooked data table, likely `/Game/Dune/Systems/Building/Data/DT_BuildableStructureCategoryData` | `BuildingPiece` / `m_MaximumNumberOfBuildables` | Extracted asset strings include `DT_BuildableStructureCategoryData`, `BuildableStructureLimitData`, `BuildingPiece`, `m_BuildableStructureLimitsOnServer`, `m_BuildableStructureLimitsPerMap`, `m_MaximumNumberOfBuildables`, and `m_TargetNumberOfLandclaims`; adjacent payload entry `03505-00ed78` contains int32 `5000` in the `BuildingPiece` row before the `Production` row | Candidate / boot-validated | Best current lead for the per-base building-piece cap. Cooked pak patching to `7500` is implemented and boot-validated in the `kspld0` handoff lab. Actual client placement past `5000` still needs client/RPC validation. |
| Unknown, likely building-related | `m_BuildableStructureLimitsPerMap` | Binary and `DT_BuildableStructureCategoryData` strings contain `m_BuildableStructureLimitsPerMap` and `m_BuildableStructureLimitsPerMap_Key` | Candidate / investigate | Possible buildable structure limit map used by category rows. Needs section/asset override discovery and live validation before use. |
| Unknown, likely admin-related | `m_AdminPasswords` | Binary contains `m_AdminPasswords` and `m_AdminPasswords_Key` | Candidate / investigate | Possible admin-password map/list used by an internal admin path. Do not use until section and auth behavior are understood. |

## Validation Notes From This Pass

- I did not mark binary-only strings as validated unless they also appear in shipped config or have strong section evidence.
- `_Key` companion strings are useful evidence that a property is a map/set-like Unreal field, but they are not themselves the override key.
- The exhaustive shipped-config index is stronger evidence than the binary-only candidate index.
- Live validation still requires a restart and in-game test, especially for building, inventory, travel, and Coriolis/wipe behavior.

## Validation Checklist

- Restart the server after changing `config/UserGame.ini`; these are startup config values.
- Do not use `m_MaxLandclaimSegmentsPerMap` as the validation target for the 3 subfief/totem cap; that cap appears to be driven by player attributes (`SubfiefLimitBonus` / `SubfiefCount`) or cooked game data.
- Validate `m_MaxNumLandclaimSegments=10` with a client carrying the same setting, because Funcom's shipped setup comments require the segment cap on both server and client.
- Validate `m_LimitNumberOfBuildablesPerServer` / `m_LimitNumberOfBuildablesPerMap` by restarting affected map containers and attempting to build past 5000 pieces. These are binary-only candidates, not shipped default keys, and probably represent a broader map/server layer rather than the per-base cap.
- Continue per-base piece-cap research in `DT_BuildableStructureCategoryData` / `BuildingPiece`; this is currently stronger evidence than the map/server INI candidate.
- Avoid changing `m_BuildingBlueprintMaxExtensions` or `m_BaseBackupMaxExtensions` while testing base count; they control extension/reconstruction limits, not the active base cap.

## Source Evidence

- Repo override file: `config/UserGame.ini`.
- Shipped setup file: `Dune Awakening Self-Hosted Server/scripts/setup/config/UserGame.ini`.
- Shipped default config extracted from server image: `DuneSandbox/Config/DefaultGame.ini`.
- Shipped server binary string evidence: `DuneSandboxServer-Linux-Shipping` contains `m_MaxLandclaimSegmentsPerMap` and `m_MaxLandclaimSegmentsPerMap_Key`.
